\usage{
make_ggraph_ligand_target_links(lr_target_prior_cor_filtered, prioritized_tbl_oi, colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{lr_target_prior_cor_filtered}{Data frame filtered from `lr_target_prior_cor` (= output of `multi_nichenet_analysis` or `lr_target_prior_cor_inference`). Filter should be done to keep onl LR-->Target links that are both supported by prior knowledge and correlation in terms of expression.}

\item{prioritized_tbl_oi}{Subset of `prioritization_tables$group_prioritization_tbl`: the ligand-receptor interactions shown in this subset will be visualized: recommended to consider the top n LR interactions of a group of interest, based on the prioritization_score (eg n = 50; see vignettes for examples).}

\item{colors}{Named vector of colors associated to each sender cell type. Vector = color, names = sender names.}
}
\value{
ggplot object with plot of LR-->Target links
}
\description{
\code{make_ggraph_ligand_target_links} Make a network showing the gene regulatory links between ligands from sender cell types to their induced ligands/receptors in receiver cell types. Lins are only drawn if the ligand/receptor in the receiver is a potential downstream target of the ligand based on prior knowledge and sufficient correlation in expression across the different samples.
